# Ghibli Films React App

## Overview
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a playground to create something fun with React.js while pulling data from different sources like the [Unofficial Ghibli API](https://github.com/janaipakos/ghibliapi), the [Unofficial Ghibli YouTube Videos API](https://github.com/elisavetTriant/ghibli-movies-api) and Youtube.

It's loosely inspired from the [Robofriends App](https://github.com/aneagoie/robofriends) which is part of the Udemy Course "Zero To Mastery" by [@aneagoie](https://github.com/aneagoie/). Thanks Andrei! 

It also takes some hints from the [tutorial and code](https://github.com/taniarascia/sandbox/tree/master/ghibli) of Tania Rascia's implementation in vanilla Javascript.

## Features
- List of Ghibli films as it is served from the [Unofficial Ghibli API](https://github.com/janaipakos/ghibliapi)
- Preview each film's trailer as it is served from the [Unofficial Ghibli YouTube Videos API](https://github.com/elisavetTriant/ghibli-movies-api) and pulled from YouTube
- Get more information about each film in its detail page

## Running The Project

#### Available Scripts

Before you can run the app with `npm start` you should install all depedencies (this means also that you have installed Node.js and npm on your machine. Learn how by [reading the docs on downloading and installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)). To begin, navigate on the project directory, after you have downloaded or cloned this repository and run:

##### `npm install`

Then, while in the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
